# Project 2 - The Law of Large Numbers
----

### **Definition**
As the number of experiment repetitions increases, the average of the sample means better approximates the population mean.

## _Interpretation_
- Any one sample/expirement is sensitive to sampling variablity, noice, and other sources, can give variations.
- This means that one sample/experiment is unlikely to provide agood estimate of the true population.
- But sampling many times or repeating the experiments many times can provide an acurate measure of the true popuation mean.
